# enable-mobile [![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Include that script to enhance mobile view of the page. It is mostly collection of boilerplate code I used across various components demos, so here is all of it, to reuse hassle-free.

[![npm install enable-mobile](https://nodei.co/npm/enable-mobile.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/enable-mobile/)

```js
require('enable-mobile');
```

That will insert the following code:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no, user-scalable=0"/>
<style>/** normalize.css here **/</style>
```

Useful for tests, apps, demo.

Ideas for enhancements are welcomed.
